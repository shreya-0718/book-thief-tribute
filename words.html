        <h2>
            "I have hated the words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right."
        </h2> 
        <p>
            This page is dedicated to the power of words, a central theme in The Book Thief. Here, 
            we'll explore some quotes from the novel that capture the essence of the novel
            and the impact of words on the story and our lives! 
            So, here I sit with my gifted copy of the book in hand
            and my headphones on (probably with low battery... I should charge).
            BUT ANYWAY
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's get started!
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2> "HERE IS A SMALL FACT: You are going to die." </h2>
        <p>
            Wow, starting off strong, huh? This quote is from closer to the beginning of the book,
            and it kind of sets the tone for the entire story. It also gives us a hint about the 
            narrator, and what kind of perspective we can expect throughout the book.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2> "She was a good woman for a crisis." </h2>
        <p>
            I wanted to include this quote because it is about a wonderful woman: Liesel's 
            foster mother, Rosa Hubermann. She is a strong and resilient character, despite
            her rough exterior, and this quoke acknowledges this.
        </p>
        <br> 
        <h2> “A DEFINITION NOT FOUND IN THE DICTIONARY Not leaving: an act of trust and love, often deciphered by children” </h2>
        <p>
            This is an aside by Death, when Hans Hubermann, Liesel's foster father, is an unwavering presence when she 
            has nightmares. It highlights the theme of trust a"nd love in relationships, especially between parents and children.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2> "How about a kiss, Saumensch?" </h2>
        <p>
            Ah yes, Rudy Steiner. Liesel's best friend and love interest. 
            This quote captures his playful and affectionate nature, and sets 
            the ongoing motif of the kiss she never gives him, despite his many requests.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2> “Like most misery, it started with apparent happiness.” </h2>
        <p> 
            This quote is a reflection on the nature of happiness and how it can often be 
            followed by sadness or tragedy. It sets the stage for the events that unfold in the story, 
            reminding us that life is unpredictable and can change in an instant.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2> “A SMALL BUT NOTEWORTHY NOTE I've seen so many young men over the years who think they're running at other young men. They are not. They're running at me.” </h2>
        <p>
            This quote is a sudden reminder of the reality of war. In this, Death reflects
            on the way that young mens' lives are cut short by the violence and destruction of war, and that they're
            actually running towards their deaths, not glory or victory.
            <br>
            In a war, no one wins.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2> "Even death has a heart." </h2>
        <p>
            This juxtaposition of the cold nature we usually associate with death 
            with the way Death feels about the people in the book serves to suggest that
            even Death, who pretends not to care, is capable of compassion and empathy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2> "Rudy Steiner was scared of the book thief's kiss." </h2>
        <p> 
            This quote is Death's revelation of Rudy's love and fear of that love for Liesel.
            It highlights the complexity of their relationship and the way that love can be both
            beautiful and terrifying. It also serves as another reminder of the innocence of childhood love.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2> "Humans, if nothing else, have the good sense to die." </h2>
        <p>
            Somewhat sadly, Death reflects on the limited nature of human life, 
            and the fact that death is forever.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2> “He does something to me, that boy. Every time. It's his only detriment. He steps on my heart. He makes me cry.” </h2>
        <p> 
            This is a reflection of Death's unusual feelings towards Rudy Steiner, admitting how much
            he, and Liesel's story, affects him.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2> “A LAST NOTE FROM YOUR NARRATOR I am haunted by humans.” </h2>
        <p>
            In a somewhat ironic note, Death leaves us with this final quote. 
            It reflects on the complexity of human nature, the beauty and tragedy of life, 
            and the way that humans can leave a lasting impact on those around them. 
            He is haunted by the stories of the people he has encountered, and the way their
            lives have been affected by other humans.
