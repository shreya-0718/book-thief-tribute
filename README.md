# Book Thief - Tribute üçÉ

Hello! I'm @shreyaluu (for those of you in Hack Club Slack üòä), and this is my first project that I made for Athena Award!
I made it for the Athena YSWS Tribute: https://tribute.athena.hackclub.com/


## So, what is it? And why?
Presenting... The Book Thief Tribute! 

https://shreya-0718.github.io/book-thief-tribute/

It's a website to honor Markus Zusak's novel _The Book Thief_, which continues to be one of my favorite books
ever. The storytelling, the emotional depth... everything about it is wonderful and I really do think everyone should read the book at least once
in their life. You won't regret, trust me. So, yes I made this website to completely fangirl over _The Book Thief_ :)

## How did I make this?
Well, I had some existing HTML/CSS experience from computer classes at school, so I sort of just dived right into this project. Whenever I was unsure of how 
to do something, I'd reference past websites I've made (like I did to figure out how to make a linear gradient) or search it up! In total, this took me 5 hours, 
and I did learn and grow more comfortable with web dev through it :)

## Struggles and Learning
One of the main things I struggled with was the background flowers image on the last ("quotes") page. It would either get cut off short, or extend past the words, making the page
longer than it had to be. To fix this, I did (a lot) of web searching, and eventually found a way to keep the image short _and_ fit the page to only extend until
the end of the image! Another thing was the gradient, because it kept repeating itself, but once the words on the page extended to the bottom the gradient sort of fixed itself!

Through this project, I learned more HTML and CSS, more specifically how to deal with images and push them to the right or left of the screen.
